"""
‚ú® Day 28 ‚Äì Clean Code Challenge ‚ú®
üìÖ Date: June 24, 2025
üéØ Objective: Refactor an existing project using clean code principles.

üß™ Target Code:
Refactored a previous FastAPI project (book CRUD system) that used inconsistent naming, lacked modularity, and had minimal documentation.

‚úÖ Improvements Applied:
- Meaningful function & variable names
- Type hints for clarity
- Docstrings for all functions
- List comprehensions for better readability
- Removed duplicated logic
- Consistent formatting

üìç Result: Code is now easier to read, debug, extend, and maintain.
